## Image Gallery

This is an application where it lists various images and it's relevant information provides by the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/service/about/api/).

### What I used to build this application:

- [React.js](https://beta.reactjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the UI.
- [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/service/about/api/) for the API endpoint.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deploying the application.
